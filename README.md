# DB UX Design System Vue Template

## Install

First you have to install all node packages:

`npm install`

## Start

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run serve`

## Develop

All packages are already installed and integrated so that you can directly import and use the components of the **DB UX Design System**.

Simply use the `App.vue` as a starting point.


## Have fun ❤️
